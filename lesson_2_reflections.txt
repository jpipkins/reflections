What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

So it looks as if we will be using these stupid reflection files in a repository.
That means I'll keep typing stuff to fill it out. The answer to the question is 
that a proper file structure is set up and initialized.  Basically, git creates
the database it will use to store commits and other data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

Oh look, a shiny.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Duh, maybe only stage what you want to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

Yabba dabba do.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

I hear crickets.
